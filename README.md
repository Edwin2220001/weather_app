# Weather App

The weather app was developed using JavaScript and HTML. In the Html page, the input taken is City Name and the output is displayed below as a weather box: description and temperature. The weather details is taken from an external site via API. There are a lot of Modules and classes are implemented in the app to display the weather box correctly.


A simple weather application that provides real-time weather data using an intuitive interface. This app is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and demonstrates modular JavaScript practices.
